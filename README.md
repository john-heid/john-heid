## Hi, I'm John Heid 
While game development is my main hobby, I'm currently on the lookout for a back-end or software role.

## What I'm up to
- ðŸš— Iâ€™m currently working on a racing/drifting game in Godot!
 
## Goals this year
- Finish a vertical-slice of my game, Flick
- Participate in Ludum Dare
